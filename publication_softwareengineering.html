Md Monir Ahammod Bin Atique, Kwanghoon Choi, Isao Sasano and Hyeon-Ah Moon, Improving LLM-based Code Completion Using LR Parsing-Based Candidates (Work-in-progress), Symbolic Computation in Software Science (SCSS), Tokyo, Japan, August 28-30, 2024.

<p>
  Programmers often use syntax completion and code suggestion features. Our methodology enhances code completion by combining structural candidate information from LR parsing with LLMs. These structural candidates
are utilized to compose prompts so that ChatGPT can predict actual code under the specified structure. Tested
on Small Basic and C benchmarks, this approach offers textual suggestions rather than just structural ones,
showing nearly 50% prediction accuracy for Small Basic programs. While effective for Small Basic, we report that
challenges remain with C11 programs.

Kwanghoon Choi, Sooyeon Hwang, Hyeonah Moon, Isao Sasano,  ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing, pp.1242-1251, Avila, Spain, April 8-12, 2024

<p>
  This paper introduces a novel text-based syntax completion method that generates a sorted list of syntactic structure candidates for program writing. To date, no existing methods for syntax structure completion have offered candidates with accompanying rank information. We developed two key algorithms using LR parsing: one for collecting and ranking candidates, and another for querying them. With these algorithms, we gathered ranked candidates from SmallBasic programs in its community and from C11 programs in open-source software. We then assessed their effectiveness in code completion using Microsoft SmallBasic tutorial programs and the exercises from Kernighan and Ritchie's C programming language book. Our findings revealed that the top ranked candidate is frequently the correct choice. Furthermore, in over 96% of the cases, the correct completion is within the top 10 ranked candidates. This indicates the value of the collected rank information, assisting users in candidate selection during introductory programming tasks. Moreover, our method exhibits language-parametric characteristics; it can be applied to any programming language with syntax defined by an LR grammar.

    <a name="syntaxcompletion_scp"> <h3> A text-based syntax completion method using LR parsing and Its Evaluation</h3></a>
Isao Sasano, Kwanghoon Choi, Science of Computer Programming, Volume 228, June 2023.

<p>
  This paper presents a text-based syntax completion method that uses
  an LR parser. We propose formal definitions of candidate text to be
  completed based on the sentential forms. Moreover, we design basic
  algorithms for computing candidate texts through reductions in the
  LR parsing. This is unlike most existing methods, wherein the definition
  of candidates that are intended to be generated are given
  informally. In addition, this is unlike grammar transformation
  approaches that use LR parsers and is a currently burdensome
  task. The proposed method allows LR parsers to be adopted without
  modification and a syntax completion system to be built without
  incurring efforts. For practical purposes, we extended the basic
  algorithms using a new definition of refined candidates and a new
  strategy. The extended algorithms can compute more useful candidates
  for realistic programming language grammars than those of existing
  ones; Further, we implemented the algorithms on an Emacs server to
  demonstrate the feasibility of their application. We evaluated the
  extended algorithm with three real-world programming languages,
  Small Basic, C, and Haskell. The extended algorithm computes
  half of all candidates in less than or equal to 0.2 seconds and
  89.2\% in approximately one second in the evaluation
  while computing the remaining candidates took a long time. We
  discuss its evaluation in detail.

    <h3> A text-based syntax completion method using LR parsing</h3></a>
Isao Sasano, Kwanghoon Choi, PEPM 2021, January 2021.

<p>
  This paper presents a text-based syntax completion method using an
  LR parser. We propose formal definitions of candidate text to be
  completed based on the sentential forms, and we design algorithms
  for computing candidates through reductions in the LR parsing. This
  is in contrast to the existing methods that have not clearly stated
  what candidates they intend to produce. This is also different from
  a transformation approach using an LR parser, which transforms the
  grammar of the programming language, a burdensome task at this
  moment. The advantage of our method is that LR parsers can be
  adopted without modification, and a syntax completion system can be
  built using them, without incurring efforts. We implemented the
  algorithms as an Emacs server to demonstrate the feasibility of
  their application.

This paper proposes two ways to develop LR parsers easily. First, one can write a
parser specification in a general programming language and derive the benefits of syntax error
checking, code completion, and type-error checking over the specification from the language’s
development environment. Second, to make it easy to develop a parser tool for a new programming
language, the automata generation for the parser specifications is in a modular form. With the idea
proposed in this study, we developed a tool for writing parsers in Python, Java, C++, and Haskell. We
also demonstrated the two aforementioned advantages in an experiment.

Byeong-Mo Chang, Kyung-Min Lee, Ga-Young Koh, Kwanghoon Choi, 
        IET Software, Vol.16, No. 6, pp. 576-602, December 2022

<p>
Internet of things (IoT) applications called SmartApps are
event-driven programs running on the SmartThings cloud. To understand
the behaviour of SmartApps, users may have questions regarding which
execution flows follow particular events or why specific actions
occur. However, checking internal programme behaviours, such as
event-driven execution flows, is more difficult for users because
SmartApps run on the cloud. In this paper, we propose SmartProvenance,
which is a provenance system for IoT applications and provides a
graphical user interface (GUI) environment for provenance queries on
event flow graphs. The event flow graph of a SmartApp visualises all
execution control flows initiated by events, which are constructed by
performing static programme analysis. The graph is decorated with
dynamically collected event and action information in the GUI
interface for provenance queries. Then, users can query the provenance
by simply clicking on the graph. An event flow graph as the form of a
GUI for queries in the SmartProvenance system allows users to view IoT
services by all possible event flow paths in a SmartApp. Thus, the
provenance information being visualised on the event flow graph can be
intuitively understood in the context of IoT services. Therefore,
users can answer provenance questions themselves without difficulty.

	Environment for IoT</h3></a>
    Na-Yeon Bak and Byeong-Mo Chang, Kwanghoon Choi,
    Journal of Computer Languages, 60(100999) October 2020.

<p>
A visual block programming language allows users to make their own
programs by dragging and dropping graphic blocks rather than by
writing the program. This enables users who are not proficient in
programming to create programs easily. Although existing studies have
applied this idea to programming Internet of things (IoT)
applications, existing visual language tools have certain limitations
in terms of expressiveness, extensibility, and error prevention. In
this paper, we propose a visual block language called Smart Block for
SmartThings home automation, together with a visual programming
environment that supports the three properties. We designed the visual
block language based on the Internet of things automation (IoTa)
calculus, a core calculus for IoT automation that generalizes
event-condition-action (ECA) rules. Each ECA rule specifies that when
an event occurs, and if a condition is met, a certain action is
performed. Smart Block supports writing IoT applications in the ECA
style and is implemented with Google Blockly, a client-side JavaScript
library for creating visual block languages. Smart Block can help
users develop reliable SmartApps by checking for redundancy,
inconsistency, and circularity in the ECA rules before generating the
code. We demonstrate that Smart Block can build 54 out of 56 (96.4%)
of the SmartApps provided by the official SmartThings
IDE. Furthermore, a user study with 33 participants shows that our
approach, based on the foundation of the IoTa calculus, is
understandable for users.

	Static Analysis</h3></a>
    Na-Yeon Bak, Byeong-Mo Chang, Kwanghoon Choi
    IET Software, 14(4), August 2020.

<p>
SmartThings is one of the most widely used smart home platforms for
the internet of things (IoT). SmartApps are IoT applications on the
SmartThings platform that enables automation of home
devices. SmartApps are event-driven; inputs are received from device
events, and outputs are issued to control devices. Understanding the
behaviour of IoT applications is a challenge because the inputs and
outputs are rarely visible. To tackle the challenge, the proposed
approach is to visualise IoT applications as a set of IoT
services. The authors propose an event-flow-based visualisation method
where a flow from an event to action is viewed as an IoT service. The
authors implement a tool called SmartVisual that performs a static
analysis on SmartApps to generate a diagram of event flows. The tool
also provides a tree model of the static structure of SmartApps and
software metrics relevant to the event-driven nature. The tool was
applied to 64 SmartApp samples provided by SmartThings. Each SmartApp
had four event flows on average, although the most complex SmartApp
had 58 event flows, and two inputs and two outputs, and the average
length of the event flows was 1.43 methods.

	Applications Using Static Analysis</h3>
    Byeong-Mo Chang, Janine Cassandra Son, Kwanghoon Choi
      KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, 14(6), June 2020.
      
      <p>
SmartThings is one of the most popular open platforms for home
automation IoT solutions that allows users to create their own
applications called SmartApps for personal use or for public
distribution. The nature of openness demands high standards on the
quality of SmartApps, but there have been few studies that have
evaluated this thoroughly yet. As part of software quality practice,
code reviews are responsible for detecting violations of coding
standards and ensuring that best practices are followed. The purpose
of this research is to propose systematically designed quality metrics
under the well-known Goal/Question/Metric methodology and to evaluate
the quality of SmartApps through automatic code reviews using a static
analysis. We first organize our static analysis rules by following the
GQM methodology, and then we apply the rules to real-world SmartApps
to analyze and evaluate them. A study of 105 officially published and
74 community-created real-world SmartApps found a high ratio of
violations in both types of SmartApps, and of all violations, security
violations were most common. Our static analysis tool can effectively
inspect reliability, maintainability, and security violations. The
results of the automatic code review indicate the common violations
among SmartApps.

      <h3>A Practical Intent Fuzzing Tool for Robustness of Inter-Component Communication in Android Apps</h3>
	Kwanghoon Choi, Myungpil Ko, Byeong-Mo Chang, KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, Vol.12, Issue 9, pp.4248-4270, September 30, 2018.
  <p>This research aims at a new practical Intent fuzzing tool for detecting Intent vulnerabilities
of Android apps causing the robustness problem. We proposed two new ideas. First, we
designed an Intent specification language to describe the structure of Intent, which makes our
Intent fuzz testing tool flexible. Second, we proposed an automatic tally method classifying
unique failures. With the two ideas, we implemented an Intent fuzz testing tool called Hwacha,
and evaluated it with 50 commercial Android apps. Our tool offers an arbitrary combination of
automatic and manual Intent generators with executors such as ADB and JUnit due to the use
of the Intent specification language. The automatic tally method excluded almost 80% of
duplicate failures in our experiment, reducing efforts of testers very much in review of failures.
The tool uncovered more than 400 unique failures including what is unknown so far. We also
measured execution time for Intent fuzz testing, which has been rarely reported before. Our
tool is practical because the whole procedure of fuzz testing is fully automatic and the tool is
applicable to the large number of Android apps with no human intervention.

  <h3>웨어러블 어플리케이션 개발을 위한 안드로이드 BLE 에뮬레이터
  </h3>

  문현아,박수용,최광훈, 정보과학회 컴퓨팅의 실제 논문지(KTCP), 2018년2월. 


      <p>사물 인터넷 환경에서 모바일 어플리케이션과 웨어러블 기기를
연동하기 위해 BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) 기반 통신을 많이 활용하고
있다. 특히 BLE 연동 안드로이드 어플리케이션을 개발할 때 개발 환경에서
BLE 에뮬레이션을 지원하지 않아 반드시 웨어러블 기기가 필요한 제약이 있
다. 본 연구에서는 처음으로 안드로이드 BLE 에뮬레이터를 설계 및
구현하였다. 이를 활용하여 웨어러블 기기가 없어도 BLE 연동
어플리케이션을 개발할 수 있음을 확인하였다. 그리고 그래프 모델 기반의
안 드로이드 BLE 시나리오 자동 생성 방법을 제안하고 자동 생성한
시나리오들을 제안한 안드로이드 BLE 에뮬레이터 상에서 실행하여
어플리케이션의 BLE 응용 프로토콜을 체계적으로 테스트하는데 유용함을
보였다.

BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) has been extensively used for communication
between mobile applications and wearable devices in IoT (Internet of
Things). In developing Android applications, wearable devices, on
which the applications can run, should be available because the
existing Android SDK does not support any BLE emulation facility. In
this study, we have designed and implemented the first Android BLE
emulator. Using this, we are able to develop and test BLE-based
Android applications even when without wearable devices. We have also
proposed an automatic generation method of Android BLE scenarios based
on graph model. We have shown that the method is useful for
systematically testing BLE application protocols by running the
generated scenarios on the Android BLE emulator.

      <h3>A Lightweight Approach to Component-Level Exception Mechanism for Robust Android Apps</h3>
      Kwanghoon Choi, Byeong-Mo Chang, Computer Languages, Systems, and Structures, Vol.44, Part C, P.283-298, December 2015.
      
      <p>
	Recent researches have reported that Android programs are vulnerable to unexpected exceptions. One reason is that the current design of Android platform solely depends on Java exception mechanism, which is unaware of the component-based structure of Android programs. This paper proposes a component-level exception mechanism for programmers to build robust Android programs with. With the mechanism, they can define an intra-component handler for each component to recover from exceptions, and they can propagate uncaught exceptions to caller component along the reverse of component activation flow. Theoretically, we have formalized an Android semantics with exceptions to prove the robustness property of the mechanism. In practice, we have implemented the mechanism with a domain-specific library that extends existing Android components. This lightweight approach does not demand the change of the Android platform. In our experiment with Android benchmark programs, the library is found to catch a number of runtime exceptions that would otherwise get the programs terminated abnormally. We also measure the overhead of using the library to show that it is very small. Our proposal is a new mechanism for defending Android programs from unexpected exceptions.

      <p>This paper proposes a string analysis based system for classifying Android Apps that may access so called harmful sites, and shows
an experiment result for real Android apps on the market. The system first transforms Android App binary codes into Java byte codes, it
performs string analysis to compute a set of strings at all program points, and it classifies the Android App as bad ones if the computed
set contains URLs that are classified because the sites provide inappropriate contents. In the proposed approach, the system performs such
a classification in the stage of distribution before installing and executing the Apps. Furthermore, the system is suitable for the automatic
management of Android Apps in the market. The proposed system can be combined with the existing methods using DNS servers or
	monitoring modules to identify harmful Android apps better in different stages.
