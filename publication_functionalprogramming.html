        Interactive user experiences on the web are becoming the
        norm. Client-side programs are becoming more complicated and
        have to deal with event handling, reading HTML document state
        and updating the interface. In this paper we propose a
        declarative language that supports these three facets of
        client-side browser development declaratively and provides a
        programming model where complex interfaces can be written
        using simple programming techniques such as records, functions
        and recursion.

    <h3>A typed slicing compilation of the polymorphic RPC calculus</h3> </a>

    <p>
        The polymorphic RPC calculus allows programmers to write
        succinct multitier programs using polymorphic location
        constructs. However, until now it lacked an implementation. We
        develop an experimental programming language based on the
        polymorphic RPC calculus. We introduce a polymorphic
        Client-Server (CS) calculus with the client and server parts
        separated. In contrast to existing untyped CS calculi, our
        calculus is not only able to resolve polymorphic locations
        statically, but it is also able to do so dynamically. We
        design a type-based slicing compilation of the polymorphic RPC
        calculus into this CS calculus, proving type and semantic
        correctness. We propose a method to erase types unnecessary
        for execution but retaining locations at runtime by
        translating the polymorphic CS calculus into an untyped CS
        calculus, proving semantic correctness.

  <h3>A Polymorphic RPC Calculus</h3> </a>

<p>
  The RPC calculus is a simple semantic foundation for multi-tier
  programming languages such as Links in which located functions can
  be written for the client-server model. Subsequently, the typed RPC
  calculus is designed to capture the location information of
  functions by types and to drive location type-directed slicing
  compilations. However, the use of locations is currently limited to
  monomorphic ones, which is one of the gaps to overcome to put into
  practice the theory of RPC calculi for client-server model.
  This paper proposes a polymorphic RPC calculus to allow programmers
to write succinct multi-tier programs using polymorphic location
constructs. Then the polymorphic multi-tier programs can be
automatically translated into programs only containing location
constants amenable to the existing slicing compilation methods. We
formulate a type system for the polymorphic RPC calculus, and prove
its type soundness. Also, we design a monomorphization translation
together with proofs on its type and semantic correctness for the
translation.

<p>
  With multi-tier programming languages, programmers can specify the locations of code to run in order to reduce development efforts for the web-based client-server model where programmers write client and server programs separately and test the multiple programs together. The RPC calculus, one of the foundations of those languages by Cooper and Wadler, has the feature of symmetric communication in programmer's writing arbitrarily deep nested client-server interactions. However, the existing research only considers dynamically typed locations. We propose a typed RPC calculus where locations are tracked in type-level. A new located type system paves the way for a theory of RPC calculi for the client-server model.
  <br>
(In the following papers published in SCP2020 and PPDP2021, the typed RPC calculus will be enhanced with polymorphic locations and a type-based slicing compilation.)
