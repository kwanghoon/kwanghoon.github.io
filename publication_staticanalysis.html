    <h3>A typed slicing compilation of the polymorphic RPC calculus</h3> </a>

      PPDP, 6 September 2021.

    <p>
        The polymorphic RPC calculus allows programmers to write
        succinct multitier programs using polymorphic location
        constructs. However, until now it lacked an implementation. We
        develop an experimental programming language based on the
        polymorphic RPC calculus. We introduce a polymorphic
        Client-Server (CS) calculus with the client and server parts
        separated. In contrast to existing untyped CS calculi, our
        calculus is not only able to resolve polymorphic locations
        statically, but it is also able to do so dynamically. We
        design a type-based slicing compilation of the polymorphic RPC
        calculus into this CS calculus, proving type and semantic
        correctness. We propose a method to erase types unnecessary
        for execution but retaining locations at runtime by
        translating the polymorphic CS calculus into an untyped CS
        calculus, proving semantic correctness.

  <h3>A Polymorphic RPC Calculus</h3> </a>

  The RPC calculus is a simple semantic foundation for multi-tier
  programming languages such as Links in which located functions can
  be written for the client-server model. Subsequently, the typed RPC
  calculus is designed to capture the location information of
  functions by types and to drive location type-directed slicing
  compilations. However, the use of locations is currently limited to
  monomorphic ones, which is one of the gaps to overcome to put into
  practice the theory of RPC calculi for client-server model.
  This paper proposes a polymorphic RPC calculus to allow programmers
to write succinct multi-tier programs using polymorphic location
constructs. Then the polymorphic multi-tier programs can be
automatically translated into programs only containing location
constants amenable to the existing slicing compilation methods. We
formulate a type system for the polymorphic RPC calculus, and prove
its type soundness. Also, we design a monomorphization translation
together with proofs on its type and semantic correctness for the
translation.

<p>
  With multi-tier programming languages, programmers can specify the locations of code to run in order to reduce development efforts for the web-based client-server model where programmers write client and server programs separately and test the multiple programs together. The RPC calculus, one of the foundations of those languages by Cooper and Wadler, has the feature of symmetric communication in programmer's writing arbitrarily deep nested client-server interactions. However, the existing research only considers dynamically typed locations. We propose a typed RPC calculus where locations are tracked in type-level. A new located type system paves the way for a theory of RPC calculi for the client-server model.
  <br>
(In the following papers published in SCP2020 and PPDP2021, the typed RPC calculus will be enhanced with polymorphic locations and a type-based slicing compilation.)

 <h3>자체수정 코드를 탐지하는 정적 분석 방법의 LLVM 프레임워크 기반 구현 및 실험 (An LLVM-Based Implementation of Static Analysis for Detecting Self-Modifying Code and Its Evaluation)</h3>

자체 수정 코드(Self-Modifying-Code)란 실행 시간 동안 스스로 실행
코드를 변경하는 코드를 말한다. 이런 기법은 특히 악성코드가 정적 분석을
우회하는 데 악용된다. 따라서 이러한 악성코드를 효과적으로 검출하려면
자체 수정 코드를 파악하는 것이 중요하다. 그동안 동적 분석 방법으로
자체 수정 코드를 분석해왔으나 이는 시간과 비용이 많이 든다. 만약 정적
분석으로 자체 수정 코드를 검출할 수 있다면 악성코드 분석에 큰 도움이
될 것이다.  본 논문에서는 LLVM IR로 변환한 바이너리 실행 프로그램을
대상으로 자체 수정 코드를 탐지하는 정적 분석방법을 제안하고, 자체 수정
코드 벤치마크를 만들어 이 방법을 적용했다. 본 논문의 실험 결과
벤치마크 프로그램을 컴파일로 변환한 최적화된 형태의 LLVM IR 프로그램에
대해서는 설계한 정적 분석 방법이 효과적이었다. 하지만 바이너리를
리프팅 변환한 비정형화된 LLVM IR 프로그램에 대해서는 자체 수정 코드를
검출하기 어려운 한계가 있었다. 이를 극복하기 위해 바이너리를 리프팅
하는 효과적인 방법이 필요하다.

Self-Modifying-Code is a code that changes the code by itself during
execution time. This technique is particularly abused by malicious
code to bypass static analysis. Therefor, in order to effectively
detect such malicious codes, it is important to identify
self-modifying-codes. In the meantime, Self-modify-codes have been
analyzed using dynamic analysis methods, but this is time-consuming
and costly. If static analysis can detect self-modifying-code it will
be of great help to malicious code analysis.  In this paper, we
propose a static analysis method to detect self-modified code for
binary executable programs converted to LLVM IR and apply this method
by making a self-modifying-code benchmark. As a result of the
experiment in this paper, the designed static analysis method was
effective for the standardized LLVM IR program that was compiled and
converted to the benchmark program. However, there was a limitation in
that it was difficult to detect the self-modifying-code for the
unstructured LLVM IR program in which the binary was lifted and
transformed. To overcome this, we need an effective way to lift the
binary code.

    <h3> A GQM Approach to Evaluation of the Quality of SmartThings
	Applications Using Static Analysis</h3>
    Byeong-Mo Chang, Janine Cassandra Son, Kwanghoon Choi
      KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, 14(6), June 2020.
      
      <p>
SmartThings is one of the most popular open platforms for home
automation IoT solutions that allows users to create their own
applications called SmartApps for personal use or for public
distribution. The nature of openness demands high standards on the
quality of SmartApps, but there have been few studies that have
evaluated this thoroughly yet. As part of software quality practice,
code reviews are responsible for detecting violations of coding
standards and ensuring that best practices are followed. The purpose
of this research is to propose systematically designed quality metrics
under the well-known Goal/Question/Metric methodology and to evaluate
the quality of SmartApps through automatic code reviews using a static
analysis. We first organize our static analysis rules by following the
GQM methodology, and then we apply the rules to real-world SmartApps
to analyze and evaluate them. A study of 105 officially published and
74 community-created real-world SmartApps found a high ratio of
violations in both types of SmartApps, and of all violations, security
violations were most common. Our static analysis tool can effectively
inspect reliability, maintainability, and security violations. The
results of the automatic code review indicate the common violations
among SmartApps.

      <p>This paper proposes a string analysis based system for classifying Android Apps that may access so called harmful sites, and shows
an experiment result for real Android apps on the market. The system first transforms Android App binary codes into Java byte codes, it
performs string analysis to compute a set of strings at all program points, and it classifies the Android App as bad ones if the computed
set contains URLs that are classified because the sites provide inappropriate contents. In the proposed approach, the system performs such
a classification in the stage of distribution before installing and executing the Apps. Furthermore, the system is suitable for the automatic
management of Android Apps in the market. The proposed system can be combined with the existing methods using DNS servers or
	monitoring modules to identify harmful Android apps better in different stages.

          <h3> A Type and Effect System for Activation Flow of Components in Android Programs</h3>
	  Kwanghoon Choi, Byeong-Mo Chang, Information Processing Letters, 114(11):620-627, November 2014. (PDF)
      
<p>
  This paper proposes a type and effect system for analyzing activation flow between components through
intents in Android programs. The activation flow information is necessary for all Android analyses such as
a secure information flow analysis for Android programs. We first design a formal semantics for a core of
featherweight Android/Java, which can address interaction between components through intents. Based on
the formal semantics, we design a type and effect system for analyzing activation flow between components
  and demonstrate the soundness of the system.

      <h3>Typing Zinc Machine with Generalized Algebraic Data Types</h3>
      Kwanghoon Choi and Seog Park, IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems, Vol.E94-D, No.6, pp.1190-1200, June 2011. (PDF)
      
<p>
The Krivine-style evaluation mechanism is well-known in the implementation of higher-order functions, allowing to avoid some useless closure building. There have been a few type systems that can verify the safety of the mechanism. The incorporation of the proposed ideas into an existing compiler, however, would require significant changes in the type system of the compiler due to the use of some dedicated form of types and typing rules in the proposals. This limitation motivates us to propose an alternative light-weight Krivine typing mechanism that does not need to extend any existing type system significantly. This paper shows how GADTs (Generalized algebraic data types) can be used for typing a ZINC machine following the Krivine-style evaluation mechanism. This idea is new as far as we know. Some existing typed compilers like GHC (Glasgow Haskell compiler) already support GADTs; they can benefit from the Krivine-style evaluation mechanism in the operational semantics with no particular extension in their type systems for the safety. We show the GHC type checker allows to prove mechanically that ZINC instructions are well-typed, which highlights the effectiveness of GADTs.

      <h3>A Type System for the Push-Enter Model</h3>
      Kwanghoon Choi and Taisook Han, Information Processing Letters, 87(4):205-211, August 31, 2003 (PDF)      
      
<p>
  In this paper, we first develop a simple compilation method based on
the push-enter model.  The compilation method uses its own states to
indicate dynamic argument status. We design generic types for the
states, and we develop a type system on the basis of these generic
types. We then demonstrate how the compilation method is done within
our type system.
