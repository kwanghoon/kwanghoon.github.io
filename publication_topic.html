      <p>
        Interactive user experiences on the web are becoming the
        norm. Client-side programs are becoming more complicated and
        have to deal with event handling, reading HTML document state
        and updating the interface. In this paper we propose a
        declarative language that supports these three facets of
        client-side browser development declaratively and provides a
        programming model where complex interfaces can be written
        using simple programming techniques such as records, functions
        and recursion.

    <h3>A typed slicing compilation of the polymorphic RPC calculus</h3> </a>
      Kwanghoon Choi, James Cheney, Sam Lindley, Bob Reynders, 
      PPDP, 6 September 2021.

    <p>
        The polymorphic RPC calculus allows programmers to write
        succinct multitier programs using polymorphic location
        constructs. However, until now it lacked an implementation. We
        develop an experimental programming language based on the
        polymorphic RPC calculus. We introduce a polymorphic
        Client-Server (CS) calculus with the client and server parts
        separated. In contrast to existing untyped CS calculi, our
        calculus is not only able to resolve polymorphic locations
        statically, but it is also able to do so dynamically. We
        design a type-based slicing compilation of the polymorphic RPC
        calculus into this CS calculus, proving type and semantic
        correctness. We propose a method to erase types unnecessary
        for execution but retaining locations at runtime by
        translating the polymorphic CS calculus into an untyped CS
        calculus, proving semantic correctness.

  <h3>A Polymorphic RPC Calculus</h3> </a>

   Kwanghoon Choi, James Cheney, Simon Fowler, and Sam Lindley,
Science of Computer Programming, Vol.197(102499), October 2020.
<p>
  The RPC calculus is a simple semantic foundation for multi-tier
  programming languages such as Links in which located functions can
  be written for the client-server model. Subsequently, the typed RPC
  calculus is designed to capture the location information of
  functions by types and to drive location type-directed slicing
  compilations. However, the use of locations is currently limited to
  monomorphic ones, which is one of the gaps to overcome to put into
  practice the theory of RPC calculi for client-server model.
  This paper proposes a polymorphic RPC calculus to allow programmers
to write succinct multi-tier programs using polymorphic location
constructs. Then the polymorphic multi-tier programs can be
automatically translated into programs only containing location
constants amenable to the existing slicing compilation methods. We
formulate a type system for the polymorphic RPC calculus, and prove
its type soundness. Also, we design a monomorphization translation
together with proofs on its type and semantic correctness for the
translation.

<p>
  With multi-tier programming languages, programmers can specify the locations of code to run in order to reduce development efforts for the web-based client-server model where programmers write client and server programs separately and test the multiple programs together. The RPC calculus, one of the foundations of those languages by Cooper and Wadler, has the feature of symmetric communication in programmer's writing arbitrarily deep nested client-server interactions. However, the existing research only considers dynamically typed locations. We propose a typed RPC calculus where locations are tracked in type-level. A new located type system paves the way for a theory of RPC calculi for the client-server model.
  <br>
(In the following papers published in SCP2020 and PPDP2021, the typed RPC calculus will be enhanced with polymorphic locations and a type-based slicing compilation.)

    <h3> A text-based syntax completion method using LR parsing and Its Evaluation</h3></a>
Isao Sasano, Kwanghoon Choi, Science of Computer Programming, Volume 228, June 2023.

<p>
  This paper presents a text-based syntax completion method that uses
  an LR parser. We propose formal definitions of candidate text to be
  completed based on the sentential forms. Moreover, we design basic
  algorithms for computing candidate texts through reductions in the
  LR parsing. This is unlike most existing methods, wherein the definition
  of candidates that are intended to be generated are given
  informally. In addition, this is unlike grammar transformation
  approaches that use LR parsers and is a currently burdensome
  task. The proposed method allows LR parsers to be adopted without
  modification and a syntax completion system to be built without
  incurring efforts. For practical purposes, we extended the basic
  algorithms using a new definition of refined candidates and a new
  strategy. The extended algorithms can compute more useful candidates
  for realistic programming language grammars than those of existing
  ones; Further, we implemented the algorithms on an Emacs server to
  demonstrate the feasibility of their application. We evaluated the
  extended algorithm with three real-world programming languages,
  Small Basic, C, and Haskell. The extended algorithm computes
  half of all candidates in less than or equal to 0.2 seconds and
  89.2\% in approximately one second in the evaluation
  while computing the remaining candidates took a long time. We
  discuss its evaluation in detail.

This paper proposes two ways to develop LR parsers easily. First, one can write a
parser specification in a general programming language and derive the benefits of syntax error
checking, code completion, and type-error checking over the specification from the language’s
development environment. Second, to make it easy to develop a parser tool for a new programming
language, the automata generation for the parser specifications is in a modular form. With the idea
proposed in this study, we developed a tool for writing parsers in Python, Java, C++, and Haskell. We
also demonstrated the two aforementioned advantages in an experiment.

Byeong-Mo Chang, Kyung-Min Lee, Ga-Young Koh, Kwanghoon Choi,

<p>
Internet of things (IoT) applications called SmartApps are
event-driven programs running on the SmartThings cloud. To understand
the behaviour of SmartApps, users may have questions regarding which
execution flows follow particular events or why specific actions
occur. However, checking internal programme behaviours, such as
event-driven execution flows, is more difficult for users because
SmartApps run on the cloud. In this paper, we propose SmartProvenance,
which is a provenance system for IoT applications and provides a
graphical user interface (GUI) environment for provenance queries on
event flow graphs. The event flow graph of a SmartApp visualises all
execution control flows initiated by events, which are constructed by
performing static programme analysis. The graph is decorated with
dynamically collected event and action information in the GUI
interface for provenance queries. Then, users can query the provenance
by simply clicking on the graph. An event flow graph as the form of a
GUI for queries in the SmartProvenance system allows users to view IoT
services by all possible event flow paths in a SmartApp. Thus, the
provenance information being visualised on the event flow graph can be
intuitively understood in the context of IoT services. Therefore,
users can answer provenance questions themselves without difficulty.

	Environment for IoT</h3></a>
    Na-Yeon Bak and Byeong-Mo Chang, Kwanghoon Choi,
    Journal of Computer Languages, 60(100999) October 2020.

<p>
A visual block programming language allows users to make their own
programs by dragging and dropping graphic blocks rather than by
writing the program. This enables users who are not proficient in
programming to create programs easily. Although existing studies have
applied this idea to programming Internet of things (IoT)
applications, existing visual language tools have certain limitations
in terms of expressiveness, extensibility, and error prevention. In
this paper, we propose a visual block language called Smart Block for
SmartThings home automation, together with a visual programming
environment that supports the three properties. We designed the visual
block language based on the Internet of things automation (IoTa)
calculus, a core calculus for IoT automation that generalizes
event-condition-action (ECA) rules. Each ECA rule specifies that when
an event occurs, and if a condition is met, a certain action is
performed. Smart Block supports writing IoT applications in the ECA
style and is implemented with Google Blockly, a client-side JavaScript
library for creating visual block languages. Smart Block can help
users develop reliable SmartApps by checking for redundancy,
inconsistency, and circularity in the ECA rules before generating the
code. We demonstrate that Smart Block can build 54 out of 56 (96.4%)
of the SmartApps provided by the official SmartThings
IDE. Furthermore, a user study with 33 participants shows that our
approach, based on the foundation of the IoTa calculus, is
understandable for users.

	Static Analysis</h3></a>
    Na-Yeon Bak, Byeong-Mo Chang, Kwanghoon Choi
    IET Software, 14(4), August 2020.

<p>
SmartThings is one of the most widely used smart home platforms for
the internet of things (IoT). SmartApps are IoT applications on the
SmartThings platform that enables automation of home
devices. SmartApps are event-driven; inputs are received from device
events, and outputs are issued to control devices. Understanding the
behaviour of IoT applications is a challenge because the inputs and
outputs are rarely visible. To tackle the challenge, the proposed
approach is to visualise IoT applications as a set of IoT
services. The authors propose an event-flow-based visualisation method
where a flow from an event to action is viewed as an IoT service. The
authors implement a tool called SmartVisual that performs a static
analysis on SmartApps to generate a diagram of event flows. The tool
also provides a tree model of the static structure of SmartApps and
software metrics relevant to the event-driven nature. The tool was
applied to 64 SmartApp samples provided by SmartThings. Each SmartApp
had four event flows on average, although the most complex SmartApp
had 58 event flows, and two inputs and two outputs, and the average
length of the event flows was 1.43 methods.

자체 수정 코드(Self-Modifying-Code)란 실행 시간 동안 스스로 실행
코드를 변경하는 코드를 말한다. 이런 기법은 특히 악성코드가 정적 분석을
우회하는 데 악용된다. 따라서 이러한 악성코드를 효과적으로 검출하려면
자체 수정 코드를 파악하는 것이 중요하다. 그동안 동적 분석 방법으로
자체 수정 코드를 분석해왔으나 이는 시간과 비용이 많이 든다. 만약 정적
분석으로 자체 수정 코드를 검출할 수 있다면 악성코드 분석에 큰 도움이
될 것이다.  본 논문에서는 LLVM IR로 변환한 바이너리 실행 프로그램을
대상으로 자체 수정 코드를 탐지하는 정적 분석방법을 제안하고, 자체 수정
코드 벤치마크를 만들어 이 방법을 적용했다. 본 논문의 실험 결과
벤치마크 프로그램을 컴파일로 변환한 최적화된 형태의 LLVM IR 프로그램에
대해서는 설계한 정적 분석 방법이 효과적이었다. 하지만 바이너리를
리프팅 변환한 비정형화된 LLVM IR 프로그램에 대해서는 자체 수정 코드를
검출하기 어려운 한계가 있었다. 이를 극복하기 위해 바이너리를 리프팅
하는 효과적인 방법이 필요하다.

Self-Modifying-Code is a code that changes the code by itself during
execution time. This technique is particularly abused by malicious
code to bypass static analysis. Therefor, in order to effectively
detect such malicious codes, it is important to identify
self-modifying-codes. In the meantime, Self-modify-codes have been
analyzed using dynamic analysis methods, but this is time-consuming
and costly. If static analysis can detect self-modifying-code it will
be of great help to malicious code analysis.  In this paper, we
propose a static analysis method to detect self-modified code for
binary executable programs converted to LLVM IR and apply this method
by making a self-modifying-code benchmark. As a result of the
experiment in this paper, the designed static analysis method was
effective for the standardized LLVM IR program that was compiled and
converted to the benchmark program. However, there was a limitation in
that it was difficult to detect the self-modifying-code for the
unstructured LLVM IR program in which the binary was lifted and
transformed. To overcome this, we need an effective way to lift the
binary code.

	Applications Using Static Analysis</h3>
    Byeong-Mo Chang, Janine Cassandra Son, Kwanghoon Choi
      KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, 14(6), June 2020.
      
      <p>
SmartThings is one of the most popular open platforms for home
automation IoT solutions that allows users to create their own
applications called SmartApps for personal use or for public
distribution. The nature of openness demands high standards on the
quality of SmartApps, but there have been few studies that have
evaluated this thoroughly yet. As part of software quality practice,
code reviews are responsible for detecting violations of coding
standards and ensuring that best practices are followed. The purpose
of this research is to propose systematically designed quality metrics
under the well-known Goal/Question/Metric methodology and to evaluate
the quality of SmartApps through automatic code reviews using a static
analysis. We first organize our static analysis rules by following the
GQM methodology, and then we apply the rules to real-world SmartApps
to analyze and evaluate them. A study of 105 officially published and
74 community-created real-world SmartApps found a high ratio of
violations in both types of SmartApps, and of all violations, security
violations were most common. Our static analysis tool can effectively
inspect reliability, maintainability, and security violations. The
results of the automatic code review indicate the common violations
among SmartApps.

      <h3>A Practical Intent Fuzzing Tool for Robustness of Inter-Component Communication in Android Apps</h3>
	Kwanghoon Choi, Myungpil Ko, Byeong-Mo Chang, KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, Vol.12, Issue 9, pp.4248-4270, September 30, 2018.
  <p>This research aims at a new practical Intent fuzzing tool for detecting Intent vulnerabilities
of Android apps causing the robustness problem. We proposed two new ideas. First, we
designed an Intent specification language to describe the structure of Intent, which makes our
Intent fuzz testing tool flexible. Second, we proposed an automatic tally method classifying
unique failures. With the two ideas, we implemented an Intent fuzz testing tool called Hwacha,
and evaluated it with 50 commercial Android apps. Our tool offers an arbitrary combination of
automatic and manual Intent generators with executors such as ADB and JUnit due to the use
of the Intent specification language. The automatic tally method excluded almost 80% of
duplicate failures in our experiment, reducing efforts of testers very much in review of failures.
The tool uncovered more than 400 unique failures including what is unknown so far. We also
measured execution time for Intent fuzz testing, which has been rarely reported before. Our
tool is practical because the whole procedure of fuzz testing is fully automatic and the tool is
applicable to the large number of Android apps with no human intervention.

      <p>사물 인터넷 환경에서 모바일 어플리케이션과 웨어러블 기기를
연동하기 위해 BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) 기반 통신을 많이 활용하고
있다. 특히 BLE 연동 안드로이드 어플리케이션을 개발할 때 개발 환경에서
BLE 에뮬레이션을 지원하지 않아 반드시 웨어러블 기기가 필요한 제약이 있
다. 본 연구에서는 처음으로 안드로이드 BLE 에뮬레이터를 설계 및
구현하였다. 이를 활용하여 웨어러블 기기가 없어도 BLE 연동
어플리케이션을 개발할 수 있음을 확인하였다. 그리고 그래프 모델 기반의
안 드로이드 BLE 시나리오 자동 생성 방법을 제안하고 자동 생성한
시나리오들을 제안한 안드로이드 BLE 에뮬레이터 상에서 실행하여

      <p>
BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) has been extensively used for communication
between mobile applications and wearable devices in IoT (Internet of
Things). In developing Android applications, wearable devices, on
which the applications can run, should be available because the
existing Android SDK does not support any BLE emulation facility. In
this study, we have designed and implemented the first Android BLE
emulator. Using this, we are able to develop and test BLE-based
Android applications even when without wearable devices. We have also
proposed an automatic generation method of Android BLE scenarios based
on graph model. We have shown that the method is useful for
systematically testing BLE application protocols by running the
generated scenarios on the Android BLE emulator.
